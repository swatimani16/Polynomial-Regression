# Polynomial-Regression. 
Performed from scratch using Numpy and matplotlib. 
code_final.py-> contains the results as shown in the '"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" book by Christopher M.Bishop'. for different values of M=[0,1,3,9]. Regularization for M=9 is also computed and plotted as shown in the book.
 comp_exam_1.py-> has the data changed from code_final.py and also for M=9, taking different values of lambda, plotted the graphs.
